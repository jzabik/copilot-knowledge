Master Level Preparation

? 50% (at least!) of the MCAT(r) is test taking skills
• Recognize the structure of the exam
• Develop a flexible study strategy and plan
• Daily passages are critical
• Practice exams should be taken every few weeks
• https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojMRs_eMtKg&t= 72s
? 50% is knowledge
• Diagnostic exam can identify areas of weakness
• Practice exams and area specific questions can help identify if your study strategy is working and if you are learning the content

Master Level Preparation: Details Matter!

? How you utilize the practice exams is critical!
? After each practice exam be very specific with why you missed questions:
• Must recognize which 1/2 of the test -->	50% is test taking skills and 50% is knowledge...
o If it is knowledge -->	be very specific
o If it is test taking skills -->	what aspect
o Follow your results to help with your study strategy
-->	stay flexible
o If your score is "stuck" -->	please determine why
o Know that improvement is incremental

Master Level Preparation

? How do you know if you understand?
• Must be able to teach the topic
• Why a study group might be beneficial

? Are "flash cards" a good idea?
• Anki is great if used correctly...
• Spaced repetition works!

Spaced Repetition

Making the Most of Anki for MCAT Prep (from an M1)

• Anki is a powerful flashcard tool built on spaced repetition - highly effective for long-term retention.

- Use premade decks (e.g., MilesDown) or create your own for personalized learning.
- Customize cards with text, images, cloze deletions, and tags.
- Card types:
• Basic: Front/Back
• Cloze: Fill-in-the-blank (ideal for active recall)
• Custom: Audio, image occlusion, etc.
- Add-ons make Anki more powerful:
• AnkiHub (sync decks to their online counterparts)
• Image Occlusion Enhanced
• Hierarchical Tags 2
• Review Heatmap (see picture)
- Tailor your study strategy: modify card intervals, use filtered decks for weak areas.

More than one slide can't cover all: explore the Anki manual at https://docs.ankiweb.net/ and online tutorials.

Master Level Preparation: Mindset

? Arguably the most important aspect!
• A positive mindset has a huge impact on your preparation and score
• Make time for wellness

? How do you know if you are burned out?
• Can explain why your score is "stuck"
• Impactful on your study efficiency
