Shadowing/Observing in the Kentucky Children's Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit
These are intended to be a general guide, and may vary depending on the Neonatology Faculty that is being shadowed/observed.
The verbiage below is intended for shadowing Dr. Ballard.
* You must have your observers badge from the OLE office in order to shadow.  If you forget your badge, you cannot shadow.  
* Note:  medical students will not need to contact the OLE office, but must have their hospital ID badge.
* Please coordinate any and all shadowing with the Neonatology Faculty prior to arriving or through the Neonatology Interest Group.
* While rounding you should be taking notes of anything that you do not understand.  Investigating those topics that you don't understand should be your homework.  The intent is to help you stay mentally engaged during rounds, and to help improve your experience while shadowing.  And this will also help with your journaling about your shadowing experience for future reference.
* Arrive to the first floor NICU (Kentucky Children's Hospital 1st floor) by 07:30, and politely ask the clerk to let you into the NICU and take you to the resident workroom.  Politely tell the NICU front desk clerk on the first floor the following:  "I am shadowing Dr. Ballard today, and he asked me to go the resident workroom, can you please help?"  Once you are here, please text me (859-321-5878) and let me know that you have arrived.  I would suggest texting me prior to the start of your shadowing experience, so that I can have your contact information.  Arriving by 07:30 will allow you to pre-round with the medical students/residents.
* Attire:  scrubs (you will need to acquire/buy your own scrubs, preferably blue) and tennis shoes (must be closed-toed shoes per NICU policy).  Please do not wear any jewelry.  No white coat or stethoscope. 
* Rounds will start around 08:30/9:00 depending on the day.  Other delays can occur based on newborn deliveries, admissions, or critically ill patients.
* Rounds will typically last til 11:00/11:30 depending on the number of patients and the acuity of the team.
* You can leave whenever necessary, but please let us know when you will be leaving.
* Feel free to email (hubie.ballard@uky.edu) or text (859-321-5878) with any questions.
