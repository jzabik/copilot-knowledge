Introductions and Basic Information:
- Each person does brief intro
- Quantify the number of current medical students and estimated number of applicants
o Allopathic vs. osteopathic
o Common non-US schools

Know your why?
- Most important detail
- May need to journal in order to help articulate

Quantitative Measures
- GPA:  average for those who are accepted vs. not accepted
o Importance of BCPM
- MCAT:  average for those accepted, and the idea of threshold scores
o Ivy league scores vs. non-Ivy league
o Preparing for the MCAT
* Timing based on pre-requisites
* Taking a prep class
* Importance of being organized and disciplined

Qualitative Measures
- Clinical exposure and shadowing are critical
o Clinical exposure can be working in a healthcare role
o Shadowing should result in meaningful stories
- Volunteerism must be meaningful
o Directly helping those in need
o Related to your passion for helping others

Letters of Recommendation
- AAMC requirements:  2 from your major and 1 from STEM (?)
- Should be from faculty who know you, i.e. might need to cultivate the relationship
o Should have an A in their class
o Attend their office hours
o Ask intelligent questions
o If you have done research, that would be expected to be a strong LOR
- When requesting the LOR, do so in person, and ask if they will �write a strong letter of recommendation?�
o A marginal letter is detrimental

Research
- Not required but can be beneficial
o Can help separate you from the pack
o Know and understand the research 

Application Process
- Understand and review the application
- Always submit as early in the process as possible
- Personal statement should tell the story of your why
o Don�t reiterate your CV
o It should have a beginning (what event occurred) that was inspirational, a middle (how that event has motivated you to help others), and end (what about being a physician allows you achieve your desire to help others and why does it require going to medical school)

Interviewing Skills
- Basic skills:  3 minute answer to your why, listen and understand the question, answer the question and demonstrate knowledge and experience, eye contact, be humble and confident
- Utilize your available resources (interviewing prep through your University of  Kentucky)
- Prepare for the interview but responses should not be overly rehearsed
- Be authentic

Reaching out for Help
- Find a mentor and coach
- Recognize that your study habits and approach can improve
- If struggling with a particular class, use available resources
- What is a common mistake?  Failing to take advantage of available resources
