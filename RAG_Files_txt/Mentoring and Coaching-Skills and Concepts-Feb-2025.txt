Mentoring
Definition:

Dyad Model:

“a developmental partnership in which
knowledge, experience, skills, and
information are shared between mentor(s)
and mentee(s) to foster the mentee’s
professional development and, often, also to
enhance the mentor’s perspectives and
knowledge.”

Classic form of mentoring where a single,
more experienced individual (mentor) is
paired with a less experienced individual
(mentee) to provide guidance and support,
creating a one-on-one relationship between
the two parties.
