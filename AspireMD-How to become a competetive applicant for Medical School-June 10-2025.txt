Introductions and Basic Information:
- Quantify the number of current medical students and estimated number of applicants
o Allopathic vs. osteopathic
o Common non-US schools
- In general, allopathic medical schools are more competitive than osteopathic schools
- If you are not a competitive applicant for UK College of Medicine, for whatever reason, you can still apply to other medical schools, including osteopathic schools

Know your why?
- Most important detail
- Be able to provide a genuine 3 minute (approximately) reason for wanting to become a physician
- This should not be overly rehearsed or robotic 
- May need to journal in order to help articulate

Quantitative Measures
- GPA:  average for those who are accepted vs. not accepted
o Typically > 3.5, and higher is better/more competitive
o Importance of BCPM (biology, chemistry, physics and math)
* This is a separate GPA.  Higher the better.  
* Critical for being a competitive applicant
* For every B, you should have an A to offset
* You can have C's but must be able to discuss what happened and what you did to help improve your study habits and how you improved your learning process
* Please utilize the University of Kentucky student success center if you are not getting an A in class.  And please connect with them early in the semester so they can help improve your study habits and learning process
* Please utilize the University of Kentucky student success to help connect you with a tutor if you are not getting an A in a class.
* Please make sure that your study habits include spaced repetition and utilizing the Ebbinghaus curve, i.e. the forgetting curve

- MCAT:  average for those accepted, and the idea of threshold scores
o UK College of Medicine competitive applicant > 505, and ideally >510
o Ivy league scores vs. non-Ivy league
* Harvard will only evaluate students > 520
o Preparing for the MCAT
* Separate talk discussing "Mastering the MCAT"

Qualitative Measures
- Clinical exposure and shadowing are critical
o Clinical exposure should be working in a healthcare role
* Critical that you have meaningful, genuine, heartfelt stories to tell from your clinical exposure
* Please journal to facilitate remembering and articulating
* Journaling will serve as a rough draft for your medical school application
o Shadowing should result in meaningful stories
* Critical that you have meaningful, genuine, heartfelt stories to tell from your shadowing
* If you don't find your shadowing experience meaningful, please consider shadowing elsewhere
* Ideally > 200 hours which is in diverse specialties including rural primary care
* While shadowing you need to pay attention to the physician patient interaction, and the physician family interaction, along with the physician interaction with the rest of the team
o Please journal on all of these interactions and how they were meaningful to you and your goal for becoming a physician
o Hubie can help connect you with some shadowing experiences
* The application process to be able to shadow within UKHealthCare goes through the OLE office and is mandatory
* Please review and understand any and all shadowing guidelines
* The process for getting a shadowing badge through OLE can take several weeks, and depends on how efficient you are with completing the necessary paperwork.
- Volunteerism must be meaningful
o Ideally > 200 hours, but more is better and demonstrate your desire to help other people who are in need
o Directly helping those in need and must have stories that you can discuss about helping other people in need
o Related to your passion for helping others
o Please journal about these stories!

Letters of Recommendation
- AAMC requirements:  2 from your major and 1 from STEM
- Should be from faculty who know you, i.e. must cultivate the relationship with the faculty
o Should have an A in their class
o Attend their office hours
o Ask intelligent questions
o If you have done research, that would be expected to be a strong LOR
- When requesting the LOR, do so in person, and ask if they will "write a strong letter of recommendation?"
o A marginal letter is detrimental
o If you request the letter late = at the end of the semester (i.e. May) and you are applying in June, the LOR might be late and can delay your application
o Please ask for the LOR early, and you can very politely and professionally ask if they have completed your LOR once you have applied

Research
- Not required but can be beneficial
o Can help separate you from the pack
o Know and understand the research 
- If you are doing research, you need to have a good reason.  Please don't do research to "check a box"

Application Process
- Understand and review the application
- Always submit as early in the process as possible
o Suggest submitting the primary application on the first day possible
o Suggest submitting the secondary application within 48-72 hours of receiving
o Delay in submitting the primary or secondary from above will result in you getting a much later interview time slot, and risk the class already being full, which means that if you were accepted, you will be on the waitlist.
- Personal statement should tell the story of your why
o Don't reiterate your CV
o It should have a beginning (what event occurred) that was inspirational, a middle (how that event has motivated you to help others), and end (what about being a physician allows you achieve your desire to help others and why does it require going to medical school)

Interviewing Skills
- Basic skills:  3 minute answer to your why, listen and understand the question, answer the question and demonstrate knowledge and experience, eye contact, be humble and confident
- Utilize your available resources, e.g. there is interviewing prep through your University of  Kentucky student success
- Prepare for the interview but responses should not be overly rehearsed
- Be authentic

Reaching out for Help
- Find a mentor and coach.  
- No having a knowledgeable faculty mentor and coach is the most common mistake premed applicants can make
- Recognize that your study habits and approach can improve.
- If struggling with a particular class, use available resources
- What is a common mistake?  Failing to take advantage of available resources
